# ⚙️ DPA-E: The Execution Engine (Sovereign Edition)

### 🧠 Programmable Dialectics: One Call, Infinite Intelligence.
> "We don't just prompt; we architect the friction that reveals the truth." - *Daraima Bassey*

## 🌍 The DPA-E Philosophy
**DPA-E (Execution)** is the dynamic heart of the Daraima Protocol. While DPA-I provides the "Soul" (Prompts), DPA-E provides the "Body" (The Code Wrapper).

### ⚡ The Single-Call Innovation
Standard multi-agent systems require 5-10 API calls, leading to high latency and cost. **DPA-E (Single-Call Mode)** achieves a full Board of Directors debate in **one single payload** by:
1.  **State Wrapping:** Packaging the entire Agent Matrix (Daraima, Moses, Justice, etc.) into one System Prompt.
2.  **JSON Forcing:** Mandating a raw JSON array output that represents a chronological conversation.
3.  **UI Parsing:** Streaming that JSON into a beautiful, human-readable "War Room" interface.
